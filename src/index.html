      <h1>Planet Profit</h1>
      <h2>The leader in cosmic capitalism!</h2>
      <p>
        As you all know, Planet Profit is not only the first private company to make interplanetary travel a reality, we are also the first to make a fortune in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        We often get questions about how we do so well for ourselves. One thing we take pride in is our commitment to our employees. Particularly when it comes to figuring out how to wring every possible second of working life out of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        To that end, we have developed this very-close-to-free tool to determine the relative ages of your exployees, to better communicate their age of retirement. Not that anyone who works for us wants to retire and give up this fabulous and exciting life!
